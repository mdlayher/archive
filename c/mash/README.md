Matt's Advanced Shell

This shell was created as the final project for my CS2240 - Systems Progamming & Concepts course.  The project required a minimum of working input, piping, and I/O redirection, but I had so much fun creating it that I decided to add in a few extras.  Enjoy!

To build the shell, simply run 'make' in the source directory.  Running 'make install' will copy the shell binary to /usr/bin/, and running 'make clean' will remove all object files, as well as the shell binary.
