chat
====

An IRC-like chat server and client, written in C.  Developed in collaboration with Justin Hill (https://github.com/justindhill).

chat utilizes my tcpd base server (https://github.com/mdlayher/tcpd) and sqlite3 in order to create a simple, IRC-like, multi-user chat server.  Once the server is running, clients can connect using the ncurses chatc client.
